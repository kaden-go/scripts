# Sort download folder

This python script will create a subfolder for each file extension in the /Downloads/ folder and will move all files into their 
respective folder. 

E.g.
- /Downloads/mp3 will contain all files with the extension .mp3
- /Downloads/pdf will contain all files with the extension .pdf
